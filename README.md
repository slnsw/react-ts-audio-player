# React Typescript Audio Player

* Built in Typescript
* Requires React 16.8+ due to use of hooks
* Not dependent on any particular stylesheet
* Currently built to use FontAwesome as source for icons,
  but intent is to make switchable

For usage, see [example.html](example.html). This uses the bundled version
generated using `npm run bundle` that works in a browser. For your Typescript
project, you should probably just include the library directly.

You'll be using something like the following:

```typescript
import AudioPlayer from '@slnsw/react-ts-audio-player';
```
